# Custom INavigator Implementation

## INavigator

The NavigateAsync method on the INavigator  interface accepts a NavigationRequest parameter and returns a Task that can be awaited in order to get a NavigationResponse. 


```csharp
public interface INavigator
{
    Task<NavigationResponse?> NavigateAsync(NavigationRequest request);
}
```


There are INavigator extension methods that accept a variety of parameters, depending on the intent, which are mapped to a corresponding combination of Route and Result values.
